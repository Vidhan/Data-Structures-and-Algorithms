* Dags have no cycles. They are great for modelling dependencies where one task must occur before another. When it is required to determine a single order in which the tasks needs to be done, we perform a 'topological sort'. The linear order hence achieved may not be unique.
* **topologicalSortforDAGsWithoutDFS()** and **topologicalSortforDAGsUsingDFS()** are two ways of performing a topological sort. Although it is tempting to assume DFS alone can produce a topo sort, this assumption is mistaken. We need a Stack as well when using DFS.
* Topological sort takes **Î˜(|V|+|E|)** time.
* Depth First Traversal (or Search) for a graph is similar to Depth First Traversal of a tree. The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, so we may come to the same node again. To avoid processing a node more than once, we use a boolean visited array. 
* Note that the DFS traverses only the vertices reachable from a given source vertex. All the vertices may not be reachable from a given vertex (example Disconnected graph). To do complete DFS traversal of such graphs, we must call DFSUtil() for every vertex. Also, before calling DFSUtil(), we should check if it is already printed
